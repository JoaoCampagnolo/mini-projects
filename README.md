# ðŸŽ¯ Mini Projects

A curated collection of small creative coding projects, games, and utilities â€” many of which were made with joy, humor, or specific people in mind. This repository serves as a playground to explore ideas, APIs, and weekend hacks.

Each folder is a self-contained project with its own logic, assets, and (usually) poetic flair.
